# Load the dataset
df = df = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/luke_/OneDrive/Desktop/pands/pands-project/iris.csv')y:")

print(df.describe())


# This project compares similarities in the  index between the three Iris species by:
# Measuring how close their average feature vectors are.
# Using Euclidean distance and cosine similarity between species centroids
# Visualizing similarity using a dendrogram or heatmap.
