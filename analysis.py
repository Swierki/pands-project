# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv('C:/Users/luke_/Documents/iris.csv')

print(df.describe())



# This project compares similarities in the  index between the three Iris species by:
# Measuring how close their average feature vectors are.
# Using Euclidean distance and cosine similarity between species centroids
# Visualizing similarity using a dendrogram or heatmap.
